# Electricity-Consumption
This is a simple C project, to find how much is the payment for electricity consumption.

This is a very simple project. At 1st you insert your invoice category code.
Code must be either: 
  1 -> household 
  2 -> night 
  3 -> industrial
  
After that, you insert the present meter reading, and the previous meter reading.

Then you will see your: Power consumption in units, Value of electricity in cents, Fixed in euro, FPA in euro and the Total payment also in euro.

In this project, the "genlib.h" & "simpio.h" from roberts libraries have been used.
